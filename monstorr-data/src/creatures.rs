/* FUTURE: How could we have a built-in list? 
The list has to have summary data (name, type, size, alignment, cr, other stuff, see monstorr-lib list_creatures) and I don't want to create all of the creatures (assuming all SRD creatures eventually get imported).None
Alternatively, I could run the tool on all of them and store them as JSON instead, then I have the data I actually need, as sort of a "written in itself"
thing.
