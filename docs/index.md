## Monstorr

Monstorr is a tool for generating and validating D&D Fifth Edition monster stats, for use in homebrew and published game content. 

It is a command-line utility that takes a file of "creature commands", runs those commands, calculates derived stats like armor class, hit points and attack bonuses, and spits out a stat block. There is a lot of flexibility in this, and flexibility always requires a bit of configuration, but it should still be simple to use.

This project is still a work in progress, although I am using it for my own projects. I will provide compiled executables if any interest is shown. I would appreciate anyone reaching out to me about bugs, feature suggestions, and encouragement.

### Documentation

Right now, the best documentation I can provide is the rustdoc web pages. Hopefully those who aren't knowledgeable in Rust can ignore the extra code docs and find the information they need.

It starts with the [documentation for code of the command line tool](rustdoc/monstorr/index.html).
