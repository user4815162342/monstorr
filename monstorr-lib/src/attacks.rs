/**
An attack effect represents the results of an attack, or an action in general. Usually, this effect is to cause damage to the target, but there are also other choices. Many of the variants here are based on conditional results, which cause different damage or types of damage based on that condition. These conditions change the wording of the descriptions created with the effect, even if they don't change the damage per round.

You are usually looking for the `Damage` variant. Some other value types referenced include [`AttackBonus`] and [`crate::stats::Damage`]. The attack bonus is a way to reference the stats of the creature to generate the bonus.

All string arguments are subject to interpolation in the final description.

There are few very complicated multiattacks in the official books, but being able to model even a mixed multiattack like that first requires a few unusual structures.
