One of the variants in this value is an attempt to mimic a common reaction found in the SRD, which may have an effect on the challenge rating. However, since the SRD does not use consistent phrasing for all actions, you may not get the output you expect. If you want to use the reaction with the specified name, use that, even if you have to override the description to fix it later. That way, you'll get the benefits of challenge rating calculation when that is available.
