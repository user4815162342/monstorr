initSidebarItems({"enum":[["Feature","Many of the variants in this value are attempts to mimic common features found in the SRD, as well as actions which the Dungeon Master’s Guide says may have an effect on the challenge rating. Other features make automatic changes to the creature at the end of creation. However, since the SRD does not use consistent phrasing for all features, you may not get the output you expect. If you want to use a feature with one of the specified names, use that, even if you have to override the description to fix it later. That way, you’ll get all of the benefits of the feature."]]});
